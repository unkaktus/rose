## rose

`rose` is a framework to visualize gravitational-wave radiation using ParaView.

It is based on plugins from [`gwpv`](https://github.com/nilsvu/gwpv) written by [Nils Vu](https://github.com/nilsvu).

The name `rose` comes from the rose-like shapes of gravitaional emission of binary blackholes.

### Architecture
- ParaView plugins to load waveform and horizon data
- ParaView server packaged into a container together with the plugins and their dependencies - to connect and construct a state
- Python script `render/render_state.py` to render ParaView state into frames, to be ran in parallel
- Python script `render/overplot.py` to add colorbar and the legends on top of the frames, to be ran in parallel
- Script `render/make_movie.sh` to combine frames into a video file

### Requirements
* ParaView 5.11.0 on your desktop
* [`spanner`](https://github.com/unkaktus/spanner) for running render in parallel

### Running locally via Docker

0. Get Docker via installing Docker Desktop or via https://get.docker.com/.

1. Run the Docker container, mounting your home folder as `/home` and grids cache directory `~/rose-cache` inside the container.
```shell
docker run --rm -ti -v "$HOME:/home" -v "$HOME/rose-cache:/cache" -e ROSE_CACHE_DIR="/cache" -p 11111:11111 unkaktus/rose:v2.0.0
pvserver
```

2. Once `pvserver` is running, you can connect to it from ParaView using address `localhost:11111`.

3. Enjoy loading files from the cluster using `EnergyFluxVolumeReader`, `StrainVolumeReader`, and `TrajectoryTailReader`!


### Installation on an HPC cluster
1. Load or install Apptainer. It is likely it is modules on your system.

For example:

```shell
source /home/SPACK2023/share/spack/setup-env.sh
module avail apptainer
module load apptainer-1.0.3-gcc-12.2.0-aojy6ca
```

2. Create a directory to store executable container files:
```shell
mkdir $HOME/apptainers
```

3. There, download latest `rose` container file from GitHub:
```shell
cd ~/apptainers
wget https://github.com/unkaktus/rose/releases/download/v2.0.0/rose-v2.0.0.sif
```

### Running on an HPC cluster in interactive mode

1. Run the container on some node:
```shell
srun -J rose-interactive -N1 -n1 --exclusive --pty apptainer shell --bind /scratch:/scratch --bind /work:/work ~/apptainers/rose-v2.0.0.sif
```
2. Note the hostname of the node you are running at:
```shell
hostname
```
3. Run ParaView server inside the container:
```shell
pvserver
```

4. Create a new SSH connection with local port forwarding of the port 11111 to the `pvserver` on the node it is running on. Here, replace `node-hostname` with the node hostname from Step 2, as well as your cluster hostname and username.
```shell
ssh -L 11111:node-hostname:11111 username@cluster
```
5. In local ParaView, connect to remote ParaView server - `Connect` button.
Then, specify `localhost:11111` as the address of the server.

6. Enjoy loading files from the cluster using `EnergyFluxVolumeReader`, `StrainVolumeReader`, and `TrajectoryTailReader`!

### Running parallel state rendering on an HPC cluster

0. Make sure you installed `spanner` (see above).

1. Copy `render/begin.toml` into the directory with your state file (`.pvsm`).

2. Adjust the number of nodes, path to `rose.sif` container, and other parameters in `begin.toml`.

3. Begin the rendering job on your state using `spanner`:
```shell
spanner begin state.pvsm
```
4. You can track the process using `spanner`, e.g.:
```shell
spanner logs -f rose_state
```

5. The job will create a directory with the same name as the state file, and output the frames there.

6. You can create a video from these frames by running `make_movie.sh` in the frame directory:
```shell
apptainer exec --bind /scratch:/scratch --bind /work:/work ~/apptainers/rose-v2.0.0.sif make_movie.sh
```

This will create a video file with the name of the current directory.

### Running parallel frame postprocessing on an HPC cluster

0. Make sure you installed `spanner` (see above).

1. Copy `render/begin-overplot.toml` into the directory with your state file (`.pvsm`).

2. Adjust the number of nodes, path to `rose.sif` container, and other parameters in `begin-overplot.toml`.

3. Begin the rendering job on your state using `spanner`:
```shell
spanner begin -f begin-overplot.toml state.pvsm
```
4. You can track the process using `spanner`, e.g.:
```shell
spanner logs -f rose-overplot_state
```

5. The job will plot legends and a colorbar on top of the frames in the frame directory, and save
postprocessed frames with `frame-overplotted` prefix.

6. You can create a video from these frames by running `make_movie.sh` in the frame directory using the correct frame name prefix:
```shell
apptainer exec --bind /scratch:/scratch --bind /work:/work ~/apptainers/rose-v2.0.0.sif make_movie.sh frame-overplotted
```

It will create a video file with the name of the current directory with the frame prefix included.

This is your final movie, enjoy! ðŸ’«
